"""
This script solves the problem of clustering data based on its time information.

Image's time metadata is expected to follow a format "YYYY:MM:DD:HH:MM:SS",
although this script is adaptable and adding or removing information (say removing year data,
or adding milliseconds or the image's file index) is a minor implementation change.

Input: An array (any size) of textual time data information in format "YYYY:MM:DD:HH:MM:SS".
Output: A key-value store encoding the cluster information. Keys are cluster indices (positive integers),
values are numpy arrays containing chronologically ordered time data belonging to a cluster.

In words:
    * We use distance between data stamps to determine the neighbours, which should be clustered together.
    * The distance is represented as a set of differently scaled time information
      (years -> seconds, see DISTANCE_THREHSOLD below). The representation of distance using one uniform scale,
      say seconds or milliseconds, could cause data overflow when dealing with a huge distance.
      (One year is 3.2 Ã— 10^10 milliseconds, we cannot store that in a numeric variable.
      And yes, there probably won't be a one year difference between our image data, but when solving
      a problem, it's a good practice to generalize it to its extreme.)
    * We loop through all time stamps and compare them with the ones already clustered. If a time stamp is
      close enough (less than DISTANCE_THRESHOLD) to any other time stamp in a cluster,
      the time stamp is put into that cluster. If it belongs to no cluster, it is put to a new cluster.

Possible improvements:
    * Cluster content is ordered chronologically, but not the clusters themselves.
    * Other metadata, such as image's file index could be considered, when image's time data is ambigous or missing.
    * Distance threshold could adapt to the context.
    * This is quite a basic implementation. (I googled time series clustering, but what I found seemed to be
      unnecessarily complicated for our problem, so I wrote this for now.
    * Also, I gotta fix in_proximity function, there's a bug.
